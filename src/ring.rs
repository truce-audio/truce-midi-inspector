//! Lock-free handoff of decoded events from the audio thread to the
//! editor.

//! The audio thread pushes [`LogEntry`] values in `process()`; the
//! editor drains them each frame in `view()`. `LogEntry` is `Copy`
//! with an inline `SysEx` buffer so a push never allocates - the audio
//! thread must stay real-time safe even when the inspector is staring
//! at a flood of `SysEx`.
